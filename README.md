# Grzybki-Gloniki-Bateryjki
Small cartoony simulation of virtual ecosystem. Application itself is in polish.

### Project description
School project that I created for C++ classes, at first it needed to be just console-based, very simple simulation to just test OOP skills, but since I like creating games I decided to go for cartoony style SFML based simulation with UI and realtime animations. Code is kept simple, yet fairly flexible.
